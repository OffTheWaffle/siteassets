					<h1>Who We Are</h1></div>

					<p>We (brothers Dave and Omer) grew up traveling around the world, and as kids we spent time in Belgium. One of Omer’s first memories is of receiving a delicious Liège waffle from his kindergarten teacher in Brussels after a full day free of him causing a ruckus. Since our departure from Belgium, we obsessed over Liège waffles and the possibility of making our own some day.

<div class="headingAlign"><h1>How It All Began</h1></div>

					<p>In 2009, we spent time zig-zagging through Latin America and at some point realized that we would soon run out of cash, so in an effort to save up for another round of traveling we flew to San Francisco to begin looking for work. We bought a Honda Prelude for a $1,000 and started driving north. We really had nowhere in mind but our gut (our guts?) told us to stick with where we liked and that was the Northwest.</p>

<div class="headingAlign"><h1>Fulfilling The Dream</h1></div>

					<p>At some point we found ourselves in Eugene and immediately fell in love with the area and the community. We started experimenting with our waffle recipe and shortly thereafter, we settled down in a little orange-and-yellow-painted house in the West Jefferson neighborhood. It was out of this house that we finally opened the original Off The Waffle. We spent about a month crafting signs, spreading the word, preparing the shop and developing the recipe (which is always in the works).</p>

<div class="headingAlign"><h1>The Dream Team</h1></div>

					<p>It wasn’t long until we were joined in our waffle shenanigans  by Shimon (our dad and longtime waffle enthusiast) and Vered, our little sis.
Along with our crew of world-class waffle bakers, we continue to serve waffles that make you want to hug someone. Nevertheless! We are still just babies in the restaurant world, and we do not claim to have it all figured out. For this reason, it is crucial that you give us as much feedback as you can to help us make more waffle lovers happy. Feel free to contact us at any time 
by phone or email (holler@offthewaffle.com)
Thanks, and enjoy the ride!
